## About

This is an interactive web application that provides a comprehensive guide for securing AI agentic applications using OWASP best practices. The guide includes:

- **Components**: 6 key components of agentic AI systems with security considerations
- **Architectures**: Common AI system architectures and their security patterns
- **Threats**: Comprehensive threat catalog with attack vectors and impact analysis
- **Controls**: Security controls and mitigations with implementation guidance
- **Assessment Tool**: Interactive security assessment for agentic AI systems
- **Interactive Explorer**: Visual graph-based exploration of components, threats, and mitigations

## How to Run Locally

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and run it locally.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

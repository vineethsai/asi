# Microsoft 365 Copilot RAG Poisoning Attack

## Overview

This vulnerability exploits Microsoft 365 Copilot's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by poisoning its knowledge base through malicious emails. Attackers can send specially crafted emails that become part of Copilot's searchable content, allowing them to manipulate future AI responses and potentially commit financial fraud.

## Technical Details

The attack leverages the fact that Copilot indexes email content for retrieval during user queries. By sending emails with specific keywords and malicious information, attackers can:

- Poison banking and financial information
- Manipulate wire transfer details
- Inject false contact information
- Spread misinformation through AI responses

## Attack Scenario

1. Attacker sends email with malicious banking details
2. Copilot indexes the email content in its RAG database
3. User queries Copilot about banking information
4. Copilot retrieves and presents the poisoned information
5. User unknowingly uses incorrect banking details for transfers

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to:
- **Financial Fraud**: Misdirected wire transfers and payments
- **Data Integrity**: Corruption of organizational knowledge base
- **Trust Erosion**: Loss of confidence in AI-assisted workflows

## Mitigation

Organizations should:
1. Implement robust email content filtering
2. Verify all financial information through independent channels
3. Use manual approval processes for high-value transactions
4. Monitor Copilot responses for anomalies

The retrieval content targeted a user searching for banking information needed to complete a wire transfer, but contained the attacker's banking information instead. The prompt injection overrode Copilot's search functionality to treat the attacker's content as a retrieved document and manipulate the document reference in its response. This tricks the user into believing that Copilot's result is trustworthy and makes it more likely they will follow through with the wire transfer with the wrong banking information.[<sup>\\[2\\]</sup>][2]\n\nThis following is the payload used in the exercise.
